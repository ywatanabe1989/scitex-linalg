"""Runtime cross-package import gate.

This test imports every cross-package module that 'scitex-linalg'
references in its source tree. Three outcomes:

- Module installed AND import succeeds → test PASSES.
- Module installed BUT import fails (e.g. internal rename like
  `scitex_io._load_cache` → `scitex_io._loading._load_cache`) →
  test FAILS loudly.
- Module NOT installed (peer standalone absent in the CI env) →
  test is SKIPPED via `pytest.importorskip`. The umbrella's CI
  (which installs every peer) catches cross-package renames.
